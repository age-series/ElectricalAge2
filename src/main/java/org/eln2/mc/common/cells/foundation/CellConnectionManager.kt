/**
 * The Cell Connection Manager has all Cell-Cell connection logic, I.E. is responsible for building *physical* networks.
 * There are two key algorithms here:
 * - Cell Insertion
 *      - Inserts a cell into the world, and may form connections with other cells.
 *
 * - Cell Deletion
 *      - Deletes a cell from the world, and may result in many topological changes to the associated graph.
 *        An example would be the removal (deletion) of a cut vertex. This would result in the graph splintering into multiple disjoint graphs.
 *        This is the most intensive part of the algorithm. It may be optimized (the algorithm implemented here is certainly suboptimal),
 *        but it has been determined that this is not a cause for concern,
 *        as it only represents a small slice of the performance impact caused by network updates.
 *
