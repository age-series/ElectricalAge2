/**
 * The Component is an entity which can be simulated in a [Circuit]; generally speaking, these are little more than object-oriented interfaces to the state of the Circuit as expressed through its [Circuit.matrix], [Circuit.knowns], [Circuit.solver], and so forth. Much of the actual math implemented for a component depends on the "stamp" family of methods--see those for details.
 *
 * Components are implemented quite generally, borrowing from the flexibility of [Falstad's circuit simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit-java/); in theory, this implementation should be capable of everything that implementation is, including arbitrary nonlinear components (diodes, transistors, etc.), components with multiple nodes (two-port networks, e.g.), and more. The names and contexts are slightly changed, however (and this version has much less graphical cross-cutting code).
 *
 * The bare minimum required to implement a Component, as of this writing (but check for which fields and methods are abstract in your version):
 *
 * - [name]: A String used to identify the component for debugging.
 * - [nodeCount]: The number of [Node]s ("pins") this component will have.
 * - [stamp]: How this component initially contributes to the Circuit.
 *
 * In keeping with good practice, please try to keep this list of _requirements_ as small as possible. There are many more fields which have default implementations (including a great many methods which do nothing) but which are needed for specific functionality; if a default implementation makes sense, define one at this level.
