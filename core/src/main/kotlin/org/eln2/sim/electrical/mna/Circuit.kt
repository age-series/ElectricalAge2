/**
 * The Circuit class: a representation of a nodal electrical circuit simulation.
 *
 * This is the primary entry point into the MNA solver; in order to simulate an electrical circuit, you will need an instance of this class.
 *
 * # Construction
 *
 * A Circuit is primarily configured through included [Component]s, which are [add]ed to the Circuit incrementally. Only _after_ such a Component is added does it get a proper sequence of [Node]s in its [Component.nodes] (as requested in its [Component.nodeCount]). These [NodeRef]s may be used to connect Components together once they are added to the simulation; generally, the order of Nodes is meaningful, and each Component subclass may define different meaning for the Nodes in this sequence. For example, [Port]s have a well-defined positive and negative terminal node.
 *
 * Note that a Circuit should _only_ be made of a Connected Component (in the graph sense) of a circuit; having disjoint Connected Components in a Circuit will at least degrade performance considerably, and may cause the circuit to [become underconstrained][isFloating]--see below.
 *
 * ## Disconnections and Removal
 *
 * The current algorithm supports _only_ incremental addition and connection; removal is _not_ directly supported, as it has the potential to sever the connected component of the circuit. For this reason, online removal is delegated to a higher layer which can track the connected components (such as Space).
 *
 * The best way to simulate removal or disconnection is to rebuild the Circuit (or possibly Circuits, if disconnection occurred) without the components and connections to remove. It is safe to transfer ownership of a Component to a new Circuit, such that it retains its state, but note that it will be entirely disconnected.
 *
 * # Simulation
 *
 * Circuit state is advanced through [Circuit.step], which expects a timestep; for stability and performance reasons (especially with reactive and nonlinear components), it is best that this timestep be held constant.
 *
 * [Circuit.step] returns whether or not the simulation step was successful; if it was not successful, the output data of the Circuit should not be assumed to be in a sensible state. If the step was successful, the following outputs are made available:
 *
 * - Each [Node] receives its potential relative to the [ground] node;
 * - Each [VSource] receives its total current.
 *
 * These objects can be queried from the Components that hold them; the Circuit also retains a copy, but with no meaningful ordering.
 *
 * # Performance
 *
 * This class is highly optimized, with the goal of running ~50000 steps per second with a mean size of 20-30 nodes; to accomplish this, it makes heavy use of caching. When using (or designing) components, bear in mind the following performance characteristics:
 *
 * - Changing any independent voltage or current source is cheap; this adjusts only the input vector to the solved connectivity matrix.
 * - Changing connectivity, including resistance between nodes, is expensive, and requires the solver to be recomputed.
 *
 * In the current implementation, reactive components ([Capacitor], [Inductor]) change only current sources, and are thus fairly cheap. Nonlinear components (like [RealisticDiode]), however, may change resistances, and thus require multiple substeps to settle on a solution. The implementations of these Components have been chosen carefully to converge (often exponentially) to the correct value, but the [Circuit.maxSubSteps] tuning parameter can be adjusted to place a hard upper bound on the amount of time spent in substeps for nonlinear components.
 *
 * # Stability
 *
 * The core matrix of the MNA algorithm is mostly a connectivity matrix, and it must be invertible for a solution to exist. However, a number of marginal real-world circuits can cause issues with this assumption. Bear the following in mind when parameterizing inputs to the simulation:
 *
 * - The connectivity matrix has entries in terms of _conductance_ (reciprocal resistance), summed over all components. Infinite resistance is zero conductance, but 0 resistance is infinite conductance, and this _will_ cause the solver to fail. Perfect, non-resistive connections are best represented by connecting the underlying nodes directly--but see the note on disconnection above that this process is hard to undo.
 * - Along similar terms, numerical stability is best when resistances are within a few orders of magnitude of each other. This library is reliant upon Java's double (likely IEEE754 binary64) and all the burdens that come with it; very high resistances will result in very small conductances, and one should expect precision loss to occur if very large and small resistances are simultaneously connected to the same Node.
 * - The ground node is privileged as being _defined_ to zero potential. The exact choice of where to put this in the circuit doesn't matter, but it is traditionally placed on the node considered to have the lowest potential, often on the negative side of a DC "main" power supply. Failing to connect this node will result in a ["floating" Circuit][Circuit.isFloating] (see, e.g., Falstad.floating) which is likely underconstrained, causing the solver to fail.
 * - This point bears reiteration: the node voltages for a "connected circuit graph component" without any conductance to ground (or infinite resistance) is underconstrained, and will cause the solver to fail. This is mainly the reason you should rebuild a Circuit after disconnecting or removing Components.
 *
 * A successful [Circuit.step] does not guarantee that the values are valid; it is possible for the solver to return, e.g., NaN values. Any logic interfacing the Circuit should be prepared to receive invalid values gracefully.
 *
 * # Implementation Details
 *
 * The current version of this solver is heavily based on Falstad's [circuit simulator Java applet](https://www.falstad.com/circuit-java/).
 *
 * The linear algebra library is presently [Apache Commons Math](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/), but this is subject to change--and distinct Circuits need not use the same underlying implementation.
 *
 * The MNA algorithm itself is heavily borrowed from [Erik Cheever's Algorithmic MNA resource][https://lpsa.swarthmore.edu/Systems/Electrical/mna/MNA3.html].
