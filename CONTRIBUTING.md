# Contributing

Contact us on our Discord at [https://discord.gg/YjK2JAD](https://discord.gg/YjK2JAD)

Feel free to make pull requests or issues, but please note that we are currently focused on making the mod functional, before adding more content.

## PR Guidelines

* Please use concise subject messages on commits, and a commit message body explaining the changes is highly encouraged.
* Keep commits in a PR to one topic, if possible. This permits us to use version control to find software regressions more easily.
* Avoid mass operations such as folder moves and restructures next to logical changes in the code in the same commit. It makes the commit diffs messy and difficult to follow.
* Use the PR message on GitHub to describe changes; use markdown check marks to show intended progress towards a goal.
* Keep your PR up to date with the `master` branch to ease merges. It is preferred that you rebase rather than merge where possible.
* PR's should come with their code documented and unit tested (as much as possible, as decided by the head developers).
* If you make a PR, you agree to the licenses of the project, and that the code and content you are contributing complies with the applicable license.

## Branch Naming

Please use concise names that accurately describe what you are doing.
For example, `feature/add-variable-resistor` may describe some new Variable Resistor you are adding.

The following naming convention is to be used.

* `master` – Branch that all of the developers work out of.
* `feature/(branch name)` – Branches created by developers that add new features

We're using a rolling release strategy, so having multiple branches doesn't really help.
Unit testing should be sufficient for watching for errors in the code. If a buf is found, push a fix and push a release.
Releases will just be simple release tags/labels on the `master` branch.
