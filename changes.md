* Ground Pin
* Capacitor (with configurable GUI for capacitance in Farads)
* Inductor (with configurable GUI for inductance in Henries)
* Diode
* 12v Battery (acts like a voltage source)
* Solar Panel (acts like a voltage source)

Only supports placement in the horizontal plane for now, some connectivity issues and bugs still to be worked out.
