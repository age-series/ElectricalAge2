/**
 * The Component is an entity which can be simulated in a [Circuit]; generally speaking, these are little more than object-oriented interfaces to the state of the Circuit as expressed through its [Circuit.matrix], [Circuit.knowns], [Circuit.solver], and so forth. Much of the actual math implemented for a component depends on the "stamp" family of methods--see those for details.
 *
 * Components are implemented quite generally, borrowing from the flexibility of [Falstad's circuit simulator](https://www.falstad.com/circuit-java/); in theory, this implementation should be capable of everything that implementation is, including arbitrary nonlinear components (diodes, transistors, etc.), components with multiple nodes (two-port networks, e.g.), and more. The names and contexts are slightly changed, however (and this version has much less graphical cross-cutting code).
 *
 * The bare minimum required to implement a Component, as of this writing (but check for which fields and methods are abstract in your version):
 *
 * - [name]: A String used to identify the component for debugging.
 * - [nodeCount]: The number of [Node]s ("pins") this component will have.
 * - [stamp]: How this component initially contributes to the Circuit.
 *
 * In keeping with good practice, please try to keep this list of _requirements_ as small as possible. There are many more fields which have default implementations (including a great many methods which do nothing) but which are needed for specific functionality; if a default implementation makes sense, define one at this level.

 * A "Port" is a pair of [Node]s ("pins") satisfying the Port Condition: the current into one is equal to the current out of the other, and vice versa; equivalently, the sum of the currents is zero.

 * Most "simple", ideal components satisfy this condition, and thus it is included here for utility. Components which do not satisfy this include some multi-Node Components (like transistors) where the relationship is more complicated, or Components which intentionally leak (or source) current somewhere; for those, subclass [Component] instead.
 *
 * The most important difference between implementing [Component] and [Port] is one less override: [nodeCount] is forced to be exactly two, as that is the definition of a Port. As of this writing, [name] and [stamp] are still needed.
 *
 * By virtue of upholding the Port Condition, the two involved Nodes are often given special names, a "positive" and "negative" terminal ([pos] and [neg]), across which the potential can be sensibly measured. By convention, the potential is positive when [pos]' potential is greater than [neg]. (If you know the resistance, like [Resistor]s do, the power dissipated can then be summarily computed.)
